# Tech Talk Event Application

This is a single-page website for a 1-day tech talk event, displaying a schedule of technical talks. Users can view the schedule and search for talks based on their categories.

## Features

*   **Event Schedule:** Displays a full day's schedule of technical talks with timings.
*   **Talk Details:** Each talk includes a title, speaker(s), category keywords, duration, and a description.
*   **Lunch & Breaks:** Incorporates a lunch break and transition times between talks.
*   **Category Search:** Users can filter talks by entering keywords from talk categories.
*   **Single-file Output:** The entire application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is bundled into a single `index.html` file for easy deployment and sharing.

## Technical Details

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Backend (Build Process):** Node.js (used to bundle the frontend assets into a single HTML file)

## Getting Started

To view this website:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ganesh35/ganesh35-event-talks-app.git
    cd ganesh35-event-talks-app
    ```

2.  **Generate the single HTML file:**
    The application's `index.html` is generated by a Node.js script that inlines the CSS and JavaScript.
    ```bash
    node build.js
    ```
    This will create a `dist` directory containing `index.html`.

3.  **Serve the website locally:**
    Navigate into the `dist` directory and use a simple HTTP server (like Python's `http.server`) to serve the file:
    ```bash
    cd dist
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```

4.  **Open in browser:**
    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML structure (source).
*   `style.css`: The CSS styles for the website (source).
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript logic for rendering the schedule and handling search (source).
*   `build.js`: A Node.js script to bundle `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` into a single `dist/index.html`.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
*   `dist/`: Directory containing the generated single-file `index.html` for deployment.
